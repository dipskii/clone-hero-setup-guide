# Clone Hero First Time Setup Guide
1. Download the game from [their website](https://clonehero.net/)
2. Open the game, press **Space** to bind controls
  The actions you'll need to bind for playing lead guitar are the following:
#### Actions : Example Key
- Green : D
- Red : F
- Yellow : J
- Blue : K
- Orange : L
- Strum Up : Up Arrow
- Strum Down : Down Arrow
- Start Button : ESC
- Select Button | Star Power : Left Shift
- Open Button : Space
- Right : Right Arrow
- Left : Left Arrow

After binding your controls, press the key you assigned to the start button (in the example, I picked escape). 

That will bring up the "Choose a Profile" menu at the bottom of the screen.

Press \<Create Profile\>, type in your name, and press enter.

After pressing enter, it will ask what instrument you're playing. Press whatever key you assigned to green (in the example, I picked D).

You'll now have access to the game's menu, woohoo!!!!!

To navigate the menu, use the Strum Up and Strum Down keys to move up and down, and the colored frets to select options.
